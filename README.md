For women, breast cancer is a hazardous condition. The patient will die if it doesn't detect the disease in the early stages. Throughout the world, it affects women frequently. Breast cancer is considered a multifactorial disease and the most common cancer in women worldwide with approximately 30% of all female cancers (i.e. 1.5 million women are diagnosed with breast cancer each year, and 500,000 women die from this disease in the world). Over the past 30 years, this disease has increased, while the death rate has decreased. However, the reduction in mortality due to mammography screening is estimated at 20% and improvement in cancer treatment is estimated at 60% (Rabiei et al., 2022)

Machine learning, as a modeling approach, represents the process of extracting knowledge from data and discovering hidden relationships , widely used in healthcare in recent years to predict different diseases  . Some studies only used demographic risk factors (lifestyle and laboratory data) in predicting breast cancer , and several studies predicted based on mammographic stereotypes  or used data from patient biopsy. Others showed the application of genetic data in predicting breast cancer (Rabiei et al., 2022). ![image](https://github.com/ikranaskar/Breastcancer_prediction/assets/109754188/fb332251-d0d3-4692-b243-4f2444e37052)


Supervised machine learning was used in this project to predict malignant and benign tumors. Support vector classifier accuracy rates is over 95% for both tumors.
